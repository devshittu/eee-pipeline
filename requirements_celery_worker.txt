# Also include requirements for the core logic of processing a single document
# as the worker will be orchestrating internal calls to other services
# or potentially loading models itself if services are not exposed/reachable (not recommended here)
# Since this worker will call the other *services*, it needs HTTP client capabilities:
httpx==0.27.0
# The core schemas it will use for payloads
# The specific model dependencies are handled by the respective service's Dockerfile
# But if you want to load models directly in worker, you'd add:
# transformers==4.41.2
# torch==2.3.0
# spacy==3.7.4
# accelerate==0.30.1
# bitsandbytes==0.43.1
# sentencepiece==0.1.99
